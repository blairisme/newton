Newton is a data analysis platform created by a team from the Computer Science department of University College London. It provides users the ability to carry out data science operations on a variable set of data, automatically fetched and made available for analysis.

Analysis tasks are contained in projects, a logical grouping of data ingested in into the system and the analytical processes that operate on this data, called experiments. Experiments allow a group of users to collaboratively design an analytical process that transforms ingested data into a meaningful outcome.

One way we facilitate this collaboration is via the use of Jupyter notebooks, a widely used tool in the data scientist community. The Newton system provides an integration with Jupyter Hub and Jupyter Lab, facilitating the creation and editing of Jupyter notebooks.
