Newton is a data analysis platform created by a team from the Computer Science
department of University College London. It provides users the ability to carry
out data science operations on a variable set of data, automatically fetched and
made available for analysis.

Analysis tasks are contained in projects, a logical grouping of data ingested in
into the system and the analytical processes that operate on this data, called
experiments. Experiments allow a group of users to collaboratively design an
analytical process that transforms ingested data into a meaningful outcome.

One way we facilitate this collaboration is via the use of Jupyter notebooks, a
widely used tool in the data scientist community. The Newton system provides an
integration with Jupyter Hub and Jupyter Lab, facilitating the creation and
editing of Jupyter notebooks.
